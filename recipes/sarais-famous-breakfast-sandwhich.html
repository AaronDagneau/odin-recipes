    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>2 Teaspoons Water</li>
        <li>1 Slice Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>2 Slices Thick Cut Bacon, Cut in Half</li>
        <li>2 Slices Sourdough Bread</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Butter</li>
        <li>Mayonaise (Optional)</li>
        <li>Tabasco Sause to Taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat pan on stovetop and cook bacon on medium heat until crisp</li>
        <li>While bacon is cooking, crack eggs into a bowl and mix salt, pepper, and water</li>
        <li>When the bacon is done cooking, pour the egg mixture into the heated pan. Spread
            the egg mixture on the pan and cook as a solid piece. Once egg is firm, flip to 
            other side. Once fully cooked, fold up the egg so that it will fit on a pice of 
            bread.
        </li>
        <li>Lightly spread mayo on the interior sides of the bread, and assemble the 
            sandwhich using the two slices of bread, cooked bacon and egg, and slice of 
            cheddar cheese. Turn the heat down to low.
        </li>
        <li>In the heated pan, melt some butter before placeing the sadwhich in the pan. 
            Allow the bread to become toasted to a golden color before flipping. Allow other 
            side of sandwhich to also become toasted. By this time, the cheese should also 
            have melted well. 
        </li>
        <li>Apply Tobasco sause (optional) and enjoy the best easy homemade sandwhich to exist!</li>
