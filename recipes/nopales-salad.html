    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Cactus Leaves</li>
        <li>3 Roma Tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 Green Onions</li>
        <li>2 Stems of Cilantro</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>1 Lemon</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>Crumbled Queso Cotija</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the cactus leaves into pieces. Cook the cactus leaves by boiling 
            them in a pot of water for 10 minutes. Rince well under running water, 
            drain, and pat dry. Another perfered way is to grill the cactus leaves. 
            Make slits with a knife down the leaves and place them on a lightly oiled 
            rack. Grill on each side for 4 minutes or untill they turn lighter in color
            with the edges browning. 
        </li>
        <li>Chop the tomatoes, green onions, and cilantro and mix together with the 
            cooked cactus. Add salt to taste, squeeze lemon juice over the salad, and 
            add a little bit of vegatable oil. 
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle the queso cotija over the salad and serve on its own or along side
            meats, Mexican beans, or tacos.
        </li>
    </ol>
